        "abstract": "Machine vision-based inspection technologies are gaining considerable importance for automated monitoring and quality control of manufactured products in recent years due to the advent of Industry 4.0. The involvement of advanced deep learning methods is a significant factor contributing to the advent of robust vision-based solutions for improving inspection accuracy at a significantly lower cost in manufacturing industries. The requirement of computational resources and large training datasets hinders the deployment of these solutions to manufacturing shop floors. The present research work develops an image-based framework considering pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), ResNet-101 to detect surface defects with the minimum training datasets and computational requirements. The outcomes of the proposed framework are substantiated through a case study of detecting commonly observed surface defects during the centerless grinding of tapered rollers. The image datasets consisting of standard tapered rollers and three common defect classes are captured and enriched further with the help of the data augmentation technique. The present work employs ResNet-101 for feature extraction combined with and multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier to detect defective images. The effects of the feature extraction layer (fc1000) and pooling layer (pool5) activation are explored to achieve the desired prediction abilities. The testing trials demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively performs image classification, achieving 100% precision for the \u2018Good\u2019 class components. The study showed that the proposed approach could overcome the requirements of large training datasets and higher computational power for deep learning models. The proposed system can be of significant importance for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) as an alternative to conventional labor-intensive manual inspection techniques.",

        "abstract": "Non-destructive Testing (NDT) often involves analysing images to identify (rare) defects. We propose a method for locating and classifying abnormalities using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A particular problem is that it is often difficult to get large numbers of examples of images of defects, making training a classifier challenging. To address this problem we generate large numbers of synthetic images by combining real defects with different backgrounds. These images are used to train a U-Net style network to perform defect detection at the pixel level. We also demonstrate that the encoder of the network produces features which can be applied to the defect classification task at the image level. Both the defect detection and classification modules are tested on multiple small data sets. Our results show that these modules are able to fulfil the industrial component inspection task at the pixel level (locating defect regions) and image level (identifying if an image contains a defect).",

        "abstract": "Defect classification and detection have been explored using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Normally, a large set of training images containing defects and the associated annotation data are required by these approaches. However, such a large set of images is usually difficult to collect because defects are rare and annotation is time-consuming and expensive. To address these issues, we propose to use a multitask deep one-class CNN for defect classification. Compared with supervised classification methods, this CNN does not require abnormal images and annotated data for training. Specifically, we build a stacked encoder\u2013decoder autoencoder for learning feature representation from normal images. The encoder is used as a feature extractor based on the hard sharing scheme of multitask learning. A one-class classification (OCC) objective learned as a hypersphere using minimum volume estimation is appended to it. Together the encoder and the OCC objective lead to a deep one-class classifier. To train both the autoencoder and one-class classifier end-to-end, a multitask loss function is built. Given an unknown sample, the distance between its feature representation and the center of the hypersphere is used as the anomaly score. Furthermore, defect detection is implemented using a moving-window scanning method on top of the deep one-class classifier. The proposed approach achieves better performance than its counterparts trained using a two-stage method. For defect detection, our approach achieves results almost as good as the supervised method even without using any annotated data. We attribute the promising results to the advantages of multitask learning. Note to Practitioners\u2014Building and evaluating vision-based nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques require many examples of abnormal images, which may not be easy to acquire. This article describes a method that does not require abnormal images for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to perform one-class defect classification (outlier detection). We also applied the method to defect detection with promising results. We include results of experiments demonstrating that better performance can be obtained using our method compared to a set of baselines. Although the proposed method does not use abnormal images for training, it still produces results that are almost as good as the supervised learning-based CNN approaches. This study provides a solution to the challenge encountered by the industrial inspection community when enough abnormal samples are hard to obtain.",

        "abstract": "3D printing or additive manufacturing is one of the key aspects of industry 4.0. However, 3D printing technology has its vulnerabilities due to the defects that develop for various reasons. This project focuses to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Deep Learning model to detect real-time malicious defects to prevent the production losses and reduce human involvement for quality checks. The method proposed here is based on feature extraction of geometrical anomalies occurring in infill patterns due to inconsistent extrusion, weak infills, lack of supports, or sagging and compare it to the features of a perfect 3D print. This approach is built on the concepts of image classification and computer vision using machine learning, which is an extremely popular technology because of the availability of datasets, monitoring systems, and the ability to detect causal relationships of defects. To check the quality of the parts, an integrated camera with the 3D printer captures images at regular intervals and process it using the CNN model. The results of this project are a more optimized and automated 3D printing process with the potential to solve the most widespread problem of product variability in 3D printing.",

        "abstract": "Online defect detection system is a necessary technical measure and important means for large-scale industrial printing production. It is effective to reduce artificial detection fatigue and improve the accuracy and stability of industry printing line. However, the existing defect detection algorithms are mainly developed based on high-quality database and it is difficult to detect the defects on low-quality printing images. In this paper, we propose a new multi-edge feature fusion algorithm which is effective in solving this problem. Firstly, according to the characteristics of sheet-fed printing system, a new printing image database is established; compared with the existing databases, it has larger translation, deformation, and uneven illumination variation. These interferences make defect detection become more challenging. Then, SIFT feature is employed to register the database. In order to reduce the number of false detections which are caused by the position, deformation, and brightness deviation between the detected image and reference image, multi-edge feature fusion algorithm is proposed to overcome the effects of these disturbances. Lastly, the experimental results of mAP (92.65%) and recall (96.29%) verify the effectiveness of the proposed method which can effectively detect defects in low-quality printing database. The proposed research results can improve the adaptability of visual inspection system on a variety of different printing platforms. It is better to control the printing process and further reduce the number of operators.",

        "abstract": "In the past years, the computer vision domain has been profoundly changed by the advent of deep learning algorithms and data science. The defect detection problem is of outmost importance in high-tech industries such as aerospace manufacturing and is extensively employed using automated industrial quality control systems. Defect inspection methods can be mainly grouped into manual inspection, traditional computer vision, and modern computer vision inspection. Initially developed two decades ago, the CNN algorithms recently became popular for solving complex machine vision problems, as big datasets and computationally potent hardware became widely available. Deep learning-based methods form the foundation for modern automatic optical inspection methods and can be grouped based on their network connections into two categories: dense networks and sparse networks. Another method for grouping considers the type of learning: supervised learning used primarily for defect classification and segmentation, and unsupervised learning models, which have the potential to overcome the challenges of supervised models such as labeling images and annotating pixels. In addition, pixel-level based segmentation techniques are considered to cover the state-of-the-art methodologies for the automatic optical inspection. Still, both supervised and unsupervised models pose challenges in regards to model training and attaining the expected detection accuracy. Identified open challenges include algorithmic, application, and data processing challenges. By addressing these challenges, in the future, the demand for automated optical inspection is expected to only grow in both industry practice and academic research.",

        "abstract": "The accuracy of defects detection for logistics packaging box is a critical factor to ensure the quality of goods under edge computing environment. Now, there are few works on this issue. This paper designs an image acquisition process system and then proposes a novel approach in addressing logistics packaging box defect detection (LPDD) on the basis of support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, this paper designs a new mean denoising template and Laplace sharpening template, which are more suitable for logistics packaging based on image preprocessing, image enhancement and other relevant technical theories. Then in the stage of noise removal, this paper proposes an improved morphological method and a gray morphological edge detection algorithm. The edge defect detection of a gray image is carried out by combining the above two methods. Hence, LPDD extracts the features of logistics packaging box by using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm and designs SVM classifiers to classify the logistics package defects. This paper uses a large number of samples to train, learn and test the designed SVM classifier. The simulation results show that the proposed LPDD method can accurately detect two common types of defects in logistics packaging boxes with higher accuracy and less computational costs, which meets the requirements of manufacturers on the classification and recognition of defects in machine vision detection system.",

        "abstract": "In a real-time quality inspection of printed matter based on machine vision, artifacts are induced by commonly used image difference methods, making the identification of defects difficult. Thus, to eliminate artifacts and improve detection rate of printing defects, this study proposed a method that combines grayscale and gradient differences. First, the grayscale difference between template image and inspected image was performed to determine the defect in the nonedge region according to the grayscale difference threshold of non-weighted neighborhood. Then, the gradient difference between the template image and inspected image was employed to determine the edge defect according to the grayscale difference threshold of weighted neighborhood. Finally, the difference artifacts were effectively eliminated by the two different image fusions and the real defects were retained. Experiments were conducted to compare the defect detection rate of printed image by using the traditional and proposed methods. Results demonstrate that for the most common dot defects the detection rate of the proposed methods is significantly higher than that of the traditional difference method due to the effective elimination of artifacts. The parallel acceleration based on compute unified device architecture (CUDA) enables the algorithm to speed up the defect detection of large print images by more than 60 times. The study provides significantly references for industrial inspection based on machine vision.",
